                system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and local. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
                Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-sm">Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a 'concurrent subject'. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
                responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28
                states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the
                policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast. Periodically, national
                policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and policies.
                State governments and local government bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary schools
                and the number of government-managed elementary schools is growing. Simultaneously the number and
                proportion managed by private bodies is growing.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-sm">Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a guru or
                preceptor after initiation.[27] The education was delivered through Gurukula. The relationship between
                Guru and his Shishya (students /diciples) was very important part of the education.[28] Takshasila (in
                modern-day Pakistan) is one of the example of ancient higher learning institute in India from possibly
                8th century BCE, however, it is debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in modern
                sense, since teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and
                there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in a Taxila, in
                contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India. Nalanda was the oldest university-system of
                education in the world in the modern sense of university. There all subjects were taught in the Pali
                language</p>
